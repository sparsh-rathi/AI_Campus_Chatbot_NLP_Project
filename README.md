# AI_Campus_Chatbot_NLP_Project
The repository is for the NLP Project on AI Campus Chatbot

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**: Designed for college environments, this project focuses on synchronizing and streamlining diverse information relevant to the students and the college. Utilizing an AI-based contextual chatbot within a college campus setting, the chatbot efficiently delivers vital information in the form of notices, oral communication, and other announcements. The primary objective is to assist new students in understanding the campus processes and environment by providing essential information regarding places within the campus, syllabus, events, clubs, and more. Simultaneously, the project aims to ensure the timely retrieval of all important information, offering real-time updates. In contrast to traditional college emails, the chatbot offers a more interactive and user-friendly interface. Beyond merely delivering information, the chatbot can engage in dynamic conversations, addressing queries and offering guidance tailored to the studentâ€™s needs. Students can easily retrieve specific information without having to navigate through the mail box.
